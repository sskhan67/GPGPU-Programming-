The idea was to provide support for sets of occupation strings that were very general, allowing (overlapping) restrictions on where each occupied could be excited to.
This did not go so well.
It did at least replace old functionality and "almost worked" so maybe worth looking at, but hard to read, promises more than it delivers, may be buggy and comments wrong, 
 so deprecated.
