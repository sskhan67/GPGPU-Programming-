1. ONLY s orbital is supported in this Hartree-Fock code.
2. Input_list generation is not checked. How many S or P orbitals in a SP pair is unknown.
3. Code efficiency is really low.
4. This code applies to systems consist of H or He atoms and whatever multiplet or charge states.
It fits q-chem outputs in regards of all kinds of H and/or He.
5. MP2 and CC will be built in here also.
