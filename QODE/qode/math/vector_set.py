# To do list
#
# 1. This is actually a prototype for the concept of using syntax like (set|opr|set) to return a 2D list of values (castable to a matrix), but none of 
#    that has yet been implemented. ... actually that syntax is more general. there should be a generic kind of rectilinear list (a tensor) that
#    understands various bilinear forms and passes them on to the elements during either outer product or contraction taking of the exterior indices.
# 2. Seems weird to have space as a constructor argument.  It should it be the space that is in charge of issuing vector sets (using a member function).
# 3. At one point, I thought that I should let the user provide some back-end storage for blocks of vectors so that they can be contiguous; however,
#    It turns out to be kind of a nightmare to figure out how to let a user enforce exactly where and how they want the vectors stored when some
#    algorithms generate new vectors one at a time that are used to build vector_sets.  So the conclusion is that this is the correct level to be 
#    implementing this at.  If the user wants to get really picky, they can implement a vector class that is really just a shell, pointing to physical
#    information in some kind of more sophisticated container.  At least then, the user could enforce things like having vectors that are generated
#    sequentially in time being stored next to one another and could then test that this is true before any operations that rely on that.  I think
#    that is about as good as it gets.  It does seem like I want to embed this a bit deeper into space though to get the notation mentioned in point 1
#    to work.  As it is now, for example in lanczos, I have to make a direct call to the space.traits member functions to perform the action on a block.
# 4. higher level tasks, like computing orthonormal bases or managing biorthogonal complements (in general, already implied a bit here)
#    should be left to the sub_basis class (see prototype in tensor.py)
