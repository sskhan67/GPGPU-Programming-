# Biggest hole at present, if two functionable operators are added, should they not be functionable if in the same basis ... how to let the user implement
# that?  Would need a layer that does not immediately create a composite_op, but falls back to it if something more detailed not implemented.

# Also what about making vectors that are tensor products of vectors in different spaces ... how does that interact with dyadic notation

# How to make v+=A|w is all one operation? ... of course, the functions already defined below retain their behavior.
# Had thought about a thin wrapper vector class that stores a multiplier separately, for things like v+=c*w, but the problem is if something then changes the 
# underlying data in w ... about the only think I can think of is to make yet a deeper wrapper to the actual data that
# stores a list of vectors which have a lock on that data.  If that data should need to change in a way that is more fundamental than a scaling,
# then it forces a copy, then it forces that guy to copy the data ... still how to know when c*v falls out of scope (esp. if temporary).


class _member(object):
    """\
    + An object of this class is returned by the function linear_inner_product_space.member.  It is thought of as a vector, but,
        strictly speaking could be some representation of a function in a function space.
    + The utility of this class is to define all the slick shorthands like "v = a*(a|w) + b*(b|w)" that automatically call
        user-implemented functions to resolve inner products, vector addition, etc.
    + The focus is on implementational simplicity, requiring the minimum amount of work from the user.
      Objects of this class are informed of the user implemented functions by storing a reference to the space (whose identity
        also serves as a check for consistent usage), which contains a traits object that stores references to the functions.
      This class ultimately calls the user-defined functions:
        - dot(v,w):   . . . . . . .  Returns the scalar product of v with w
	- add_to(v,w,c):  . . . . .  In-place addition of c*w to v (c is optional! default is 1), leaving w unchanged, No return value.
	- scale(n,v):   . . . . . .  In-place scaling of v by n.  No return value.
	- copy(v):    . . . . . . .  Instantiates and returns an independent (deep) copy of vector v.
        - back_act_on_vec(v,A):   .  Returns a *new vector* of the same type as v, which is the result of [v^+ A]^+ (same as A^+ v),
                                     where "^+" is interpreted as Hermitian conjugate and the "product" is interpreted as operator action.
                                     In this way, there is no distinction between left- and right-hand vectors, but consistency is
                                     maintained to the extent that "u = w|A ; n = (u|v)" gives the same value for n as "n = (w|A|v)"
                                     because conjugation of the left-hand argument of an inner product is part of the definition.
        - act_on_vec is not called by this class, since it is called by the operator classes directly, due to precedence.
      In case some of the assumptions below break the efficiency of the wrapped classes (seems unlikely), this interface can be
       replicated and other classes could be used in code that expects members of a space, as a last resort, I guess. (Once upon
       a time, "copy" took a scale argument which would scale the copy, rather than doing this in two steps here.  Is it possible that
       matters?)
    + For the most part, this class does not need to know anything about the insides of the user-implemented function, except that
        much higher level math does depend on the scalar field over which a space is defined.  The scalar field is the type returned
        by a general inner product of two arbitrary vectors.  Objects of this type are informed of the field type by the space member.
    + A non-obvious special feature of this class is that numbers may be interpreted as operators or scalars when their product
        is taken with a vector.  This means that (letting n be a number, and v a vector) "n*v" is the same as "v*n" and "n|v", but
        "v|n" might be different because n will be conjugated, according to the field type given, to maintain consistency (see above).
      This "scalar" promotion is useful because some operators might be defined as "1+A", where A is of operator class, and letting "1"
        be quietly promoted at resolution time allow us to skip checking for special cases elsewhere, which is error prone.
      There is a special case though; the integer "0" (always checked for by identity not value) may be interpreted as a vector,
        in addition to a scalar or operator.  This is safe, since the null vector must exist in all spaces (but the promotion of other
        scalars would be fundamentally ambiguous).  Any action that uses an identical zero and results in the null vector is "demoted"
        to the scalar "0" in its representation; this is not only efficient, but it is also valuable to know when a vector is identically zero.
        It also is necessary to maintain consistency since "0|v" is ambiguous in its interpretation;  if "0" is an operator (why would one do
        this anyway?), the result is a vector, but this expression might also be an inner product, but since the null vector is demoted,
        the result is the same, and the user will likely not even notice the ambiguity.

    # Part of an incomplete progression towards also allowing blocks of vectors.

    # However, if the efficiency of acting on a block is tied to having them be contiguous in memory, then the user would be stuck on the other side of this doing
    # one of two things:  (1) copying vectors into contiguous block, acting and then copying back to individually indexable vectors or (2) implementing some rather
    # sophisticated back-end memory management and then passing around indexable "vectors" that really just point to the physical information.  More about my philosophy
    # about how to handle "blocks" of vectors can be found in vector_set.py
    #
    # The biggest gaping hole right now is that there is no slick syntax for calling this.  The user has to call this function by name directly on a list of vectors (or a vector_set)

# be callable classes or generated by external functions that store that data.
