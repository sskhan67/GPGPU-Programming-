# efficiency layer for scaling of vectors:
# another thin wrapper around a vector class which is already suitable for wrapping by the below can be used to keep track of scaling
# factors "externally".  This means that the implementation of add_to as seen by spaces can make use of that (perhaps factoring out a global factor)
# to speed up v+=c*w by doing this all in one step internally (externally, it still looks like two steps, but one is cheap).
#
# corrolary:  This still would not solve v+=A|w, when A is an operator.  Think about this long enough and you realize I'm reinventing the expressions library
# that suspends execution until '=' is encountered
