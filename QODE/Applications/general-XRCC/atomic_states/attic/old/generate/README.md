This work flow assumes you are only working with one basis set at a time,
so the recommendation is to not modify this original version-controlled copy
but to make a copy of it and run there.

Please refer to each README.md in the pyquante_scf/ and molecule_CI/ folder.

1) Go into pyquante_scf/ to generate all matrices needed (provides the Be/Be2 h, V, Overlap matrices and SCF vectors)

2) Go to molecule_CI/ folder to run Be2 calculation
