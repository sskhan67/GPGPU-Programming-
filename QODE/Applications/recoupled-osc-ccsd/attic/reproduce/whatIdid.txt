python3 ccsd-primitive.2.py 30 >& primitive.2.stdout			# Mysterious silent death of job . . . decided to give up
									# ^^ Above issues resolved the python MemoryError exception is indeed due to running out of memory (not bad memory, whew!).
									#    In the second case, log files show 'python3 invoked oom-killer', which is an OS-level savior that is called
									#    when the machine is out of memory ... basically looks like it did not give python a chance to recover, and since
									#    it seems that the death came from the "outside" then it looked to die silently.

Then ran the files:

through my plotting functions stored with the paper.
